## Short Introduction
The ORBIT team from SMKN 4 Bandung wanted to innovate in agriculture use cases especially paddy production. We created this project to take part in Turnamen Sains Data Nasional, one of the prestigious annual data science competitions in Indonesia which is supported by many government agencies and universities in Indonesia. This year's TSDN theme is Data Science and AI Implementation for Business.
